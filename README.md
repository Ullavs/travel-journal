# Travel Journal

This is a solution to a solo project from [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com).
Solo projects are meant to challenge the skills you've learnt so far through the courses; there is no solution given by Scrimba.

## The challenge

- Build a travel journal using React (my second React project! ðŸ¤©)
- Put the data array in a seperate .js file
- Use .map() and props
- Styled & polished (according to the Figma design file)

## Built with

- React
- CSS custom properties 
- CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma design files from Scrimba
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
